# This is a script to practice doing testing in bash scripts

# This section demonstrates file testing

# Test for the existence of the /etc/resolv.conf file
test -e /etc/resolv.conf && echo "/etc/resolv.conf exists" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf does not exist"

# TASK 1: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a regular file
test -f /etc/resolv.conf  && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is a regular file" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is not a regular file"

# TASK 2: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a symbolic link
test -L /etc/resolv.conf  && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic link"

# TASK 3: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is a directory
test -d /etc/resolv.conf  && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is a directory" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is not a directory"

# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is readable
test -r /etc/resolv.conf  && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is readable" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is not readable"

# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is writable
test -w /etc/resolv.conf  && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is writable" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is not writable"

# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /etc/resolv.conf file is executable
test -x /etc/resolv.conf && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is executable" || echo "/etc/resolv.conf is executable"

# Tests if /tmp is a directory
test -d /tmp && echo "/tmp is a directory" || echo "/tmp is not a directory"

# TASK 4: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is readable
test -r /tmp && echo "/tmp is readable" || echo "/tmp is not readable"

# TASK 5: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory is writable
test -w /tmp && echo "/tmp is writable" || echo "/tmp is not writable"

# TASK 6: Add a test to see if the /tmp directory can be accessed
[ -r /tmp ] && echo "/tmp is accesssible" || echo "/tmp is not accesssible"

# Tests if one file is newer than another
# TASK 7: Add testing to print out which file newest, or if they are the same age
[ /etc/hosts -nt /etc/resolv.conf ] && echo "/etc/hosts is newer than /etc/resolv.conf"
[ /etc/hosts -ot /etc/resolv.conf ] && echo "/etc/resolv.conf is newer than /etc/hosts"
[ ! /etc/hosts -nt /etc/resolv.conf -a ! /etc/hosts -ot /etc/resolv.conf ] && echo "/etc/hosts is the same age as /etc/resolv.conf"

# this section demonstrates doing numeric tests in bash

# TASK 1: Improve it by getting the user to give us the numbers to use in our tests
echo "Enter the first number"
read firstNumber

echo "Enter the second number"
read secondNumber


# TASK 2: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user if the numbers are even or odd
[ $((firstNumber % 2)) == 0 ] && echo "The first number is even" || echo "The first number is odd"
[ $((secondNumber % 2)) == 0 ] && echo "The second Number is even" || echo "The second number is odd"



# TASK 3: Improve it by adding a test to tell the user is the second number is a multiple of the first number
[ $(( secondNumber % firstNumber )) == 0 ] && echo "The second Number is a multiple of the first number" || echo "The second number is not a multiple of the first number"


[ $firstNumber -eq $secondNumber ] && echo "The two numbers are the same"
[ $firstNumber -ne $secondNumber ] && echo "The two numbers are not the same"
[ $firstNumber -lt $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is less than the second number"
[ $firstNumber -gt $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is greater than the second number"

	
[ $firstNumber -le $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is less than or equal to the second number"
[ $firstNumber -ge $secondNumber ] && echo "The first number is greater than or equal to the second number"

# This section demonstrates testing variables

# Test if the USER variable exists
[ -v USER ] && echo "The variable USER exists"


# TASK 1: Add a command that prints out a labelled description of what is in the USER variable, but only if it is not empty
[ -v USER ] && [ -z "$USER" ] && echo "User variable is $USER"

# TASK 2: Add a command that tells the user if the USER variable exists, but is empty
[ -v USER ]  && [ -z "$USER" ] && echo "The variable User exists, but is empty"

# Tests for string data
# TASK 3: Modify the command to use the != operator instead of the = operator, without breaking the logic of the command
# TASK 4: Use the read command to ask the user running the script to give us strings to use for the tests

echo "Enter the first number"
read a

echo "Enter the second number"
read b

[ $a != $b ] && echo "$a is not alphanumerically equal to $b" || "$a is alphanumerically equal to $b"
